# STAT 107 Project Group 14

PROMPT: Can keeping a healthy weight and lower insulin resistance help prevent brain aging?

Introduction
 Using data source, choose single/multiple data that matches prompt/question. This is learning choosing data sources to support
 the prompt that your group choose. Clean out the data variables that will not be used, which helps to formatting data. Using format
 variables for use and create scatter plots to visualized the data that supports the prompt. Use git repository to work on as group
 for group project.
 
 1) Create README.txt providing an up to date description of the files in your submission.
 2) Create R source code named 00_requiremnets.R that calls all of the libraries you have used in your analysis so far
 3) R_Functions.R contains custom R functions used during the analysis
 4) FinalReport.Rmd for the final report summarizing results and conclusions.
 5) FinalReport.pdf for the knitted output of the final report.
