## Abstract

Brain aging is a natural process that is linked to reduced cognitive abilities, brain volume and neurochemical activity. There are many ways to slow this process down, one of them being diet. The question we seek to answer is "Can keeping a healthy weight and lower insulin resistance help prevent brain aging?". To answer this question, we conducted an analysis on data from an fMRI study of the aging brain on acute ketosis, using scatterplots to see if BMI vs HOMA and age vs HOMA are related.

## Introduction

As we continue to age and develop, our brain does too. According to the National Institute of Aging (NIA), brain aging is a natural process that happens over time that affects cognitive function. Although brain aging is inevitable throughout our lives, there are ways to slow the process down such as getting an adequate amount of sleep, effectively managing stress, and engaging in mentally stimulating activities. For our report, we plan to look into how diet can play a factor in slowing brain aging. The question we seek to answer in our analysis is "Can keeping a healthy weight and lower insulin resistance help prevent brain aging?". 

Our analysis may benefit anyone who is concerned about their aging brain and want to keep their brains young and healthy for longer than average. It would be especially beneficial for older and elderly adults since they have a higher risk of developing neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease, which can accelerate brain aging. Looking at body weight index (BMI) and HOMA-IR (Homeostatic Model Assessment for Insulin Resistance) scores would help us understand how diet is related to brain aging in different age groups. 

To answer our question, we plan to use the data from an fMRI study of the aging brain in acute ketosis. We plan to create scatterplots from the data to analyze the relationships between BMI vs HOMA and age vs HOMA. 


## Data

To perform our analysis, we used data from an fMRI study of the aging brain in acute ketosis, which was found from openneuro.org, an open-source platform with public datasets containing neuroimaging data. The study involved scanning participants in a fasted state before and after they were administered insulin or glucose bolus based on body weight. Our data consists of 101 participants, aged 21-79, with the variables, participant_id, age, sex, BMI, bodyweight, fasting insulin, HbA1C, and HOMA. To clean the data, we removed the variables irrelevant to our analysis (sex, bodyweight, and HbA1C).
